Tabs are tabs are tabs. They are not spaces.

The program is mogvert - one word, lowercase, no hypens or underscores

Constants should be uppercase, prefixed with MOGV_
classes should be camelcase; mogvOpt, mogvEncoder
methods are so far lower case, underscore seperate (ie get_coder_info),
but should be camelcase; getCoderInfo
variables are lowercase, underscre seperated 
structs are lowercase, underscore seperated, mogv_ prefixed

All of these are violated due to running code pre-empting this style guide

-Wall is used for a reason. You can break it your machine.
