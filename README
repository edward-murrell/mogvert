This project is not considered to be in a working state. It's currently being
reconstructed from code that was last looked at eight years ago. It barely
compiles, much less executes.

What is mogconvert?

Mogconvert is an audio reencoder which supports many formats. It is designed
to be modular, fast and reliable. Mogconvert uses a modular decoding and
encoding engine, therefore making it is easy to add extra modules to reencode
to aditional formats. Mogconvert is the only program of it's kind under the GPL
licensing system.

Key features:
	- Fast and reliable reencoder.
	- Optimal performance by a single-thread design.
	- Support for multiple audio formats.
	- Modular design, for increased felxability.
	- Lightweight.

What's included in the package?

The following files will be found in the distribution (alphabetically):
	doc		- Direcotry containing additional documentation.
	Makefile	- The makefile.
	man		- Direcotry containing the mogconvert manual page(s).
	readme		- This file, general information about mogconvert.
	src		- Direcotry containing the mogconvert source code.

How do I use mogconvert?

The manual pages included in the man/ directory explain the syntax of mogconvert. You should read them carefully, To read a manual page
you can use the following command:
	nroff -mandoc -Tascii manual.num | less

Or troff/groff instead of nroff. You can also copy these manual pages into your
systems manual directory so you can just use the command:
	man num manual

Getting started

To reencode input.ogg to output.mp3, issue the following command at the prompt:
	$ mogconvert -e mp3 -b bitrate -i input.ogg -o output.mp3
This can be generalised to:
	$ mogconvert -e encoder_module -b bitrate -i input_file -o output_file

What platforms does mogconvert run on?

Currently mogconvert runs on the x86 and ppc platforms.

I found a bug, what now?

It is possible that you may find a bug in mogconvert during usage. If you
discover one, we would appreciate it if you could mail us the details. Try to
be as clear as possible in the description and try to include as much of 
the following as possible:
	- Bug summary in the subject.
	- Extensive bug description.
	- How to reproduce the bug.
	- Your system information, (OS, architecture).
	- Building and version information.
	- Any ideas that may have caused the bug.
	- A suggested patch :)
	- Any other information you think which can be of use.

You can mail your bug reports to edward@murrell.co.nz

Additional information

To run mogconvert on a big endian machine, you have to patch the source as follows:
	$ patch -p 0 < patches/big_endian.patch
To revert the code back to little endian run:
	$ patch -p 0 < patches/little_endian.patch

Mogconvert was founded by Edward Murrell and he can be reached at
edward@murrell.co.nz. If you have any useful suggestions, please mail him them.

He would also like to thank the following persons, (alphabetically):
	- angelorum (coding,big endian support,config scripts,documentation)
	- any other people who might feel forgotten.
