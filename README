Please note!

This project is not considered to be ready for general use. I'm currently
in the process of rewriting to rebuild my rusty C++ skills.

What is mogvert?

Mogvert is an audio reencoder which supports many formats. It is designed
to be modular, fast and reliable. Mogvert uses a modular decoding and
encoding engine, therefore making it is easy to add extra modules to reencode
to aditional formats.

Key features:
	- Fast and reliable reencoder.
	- Optimal performance by a single-thread design.
	- Support for multiple audio formats.
	- Modular design, for increased felxability.
	- Lightweight.

What's included in the package?

The following files will be found in the distribution (alphabetically):
	doc      - Directory containing additional development documentation.
	Makefile - The makefile.
	man		 - Directory containing the mogvert manual page(s).
	README   - This file, general information about mogvert.
	src		 - Directory containing the mogvert source code.

How do I use mogvert?

The manual pages included in the man/ directory explain the syntax of mogvert. You should read them carefully, To read a manual page
you can use the following command:
	nroff -mandoc -Tascii manual.num | less

Or troff/groff instead of nroff. You can also copy these manual pages into your
systems manual directory so you can just use the command:
	man num manual

Getting started

To reencode input.ogg to output.mp3, issue the following command at the prompt:
	$ mogvert -e mp3 -b bitrate -i input.ogg -o output.mp3
This can be generalised to:
	$ mogvert -e encoder_module -b bitrate -i input_file -o output_file

What platforms does mogvert run on?

Mogvert was developed on Linux. It might work on BSD and other unix like
systems. It has been known to work on PPC, and no longer segfaults on
64 bit systems.

I found a bug, what now?

It is possible that you may find a bug in mogvert during usage. If you
discover one, we would appreciate it if you could mail us the details. Try to
be as clear as possible in the description and try to include as much of 
the following as possible:
	- Bug summary in the subject.
	- Extensive bug description.
	- How to reproduce the bug.
	- Your system information, (OS, architecture).
	- Building and version information.
	- Any ideas that may have caused the bug.
	- A suggested patch :)
	- Any other information you think which can be of use.

You can mail your bug reports to edward@murrell.co.nz
